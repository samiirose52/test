## Portfolio

For this challenge, I wrote the HTML and CSS for a portfolio that I can add on to throughout my bootcamp expierence to make it my own personal portfolio. I have used what I have learned with HTML and CSS through my bootcamp so far. The requirements to meet are:

Divided sections about me, my work, and contact information. 
Included a recent photo of yourself.
Navigation links.
Placeholders for future projects that I can add on at a later date.
Styling for different sized screens (tablets and mobile phones).
